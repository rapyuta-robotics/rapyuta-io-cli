    """Delete one or more deployments with a name or a regex pattern.

    You can specify a deployment name or a regex pattern to delete one
    or more deployment.

    If you want to delete all the deployments, then
    simply use the ``--all`` flag.

    If you want to delete deployments without confirmation, then use the
    ``--force`` or ``--silent`` or ``-f``

    Usage Examples:

        Delete a deployment by name

            $ rio deployment delete DEPLOYMENT_NAME

        Delete a deployment without confirmation

            $ rio deployment delete DEPLOYMENT_NAME --force

        Delete all deployments in the project

            $ rio deployment delete --all

        Delete deployments using regex pattern

            $ rio deployment delete "DEPLOYMENT.*"
