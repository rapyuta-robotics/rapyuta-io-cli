    """Delete one or more static routes with a name or a regex pattern.

    You can specify a static route name or a regex pattern to delete one
    or more deployment.

    If you want to delete all the static routes, then
    simply use the ``--all`` flag.

    If you want to delete static routes without confirmation, then use the
    ``--force`` or ``--silent`` or ``-f``

    Usage Examples:

        Delete a static route by name

            $ rio static-route delete STATIC_ROUTE_NAME

        Delete a static route without confirmation

            $ rio deployment delete STATIC_ROUTE_NAME --force

        Delete all static routes in the project

            $ rio static-route delete --all

        Delete static routes using regex pattern

            $ rio static-route delete "STATIC_ROUTE.*"
